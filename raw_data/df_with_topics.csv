4,Ashtanga Yoga,"Ashtanga Yoga is a systematic Vinyasa-style class, incorporating set sequences or “series” where the breath and movement are united. The energetic nature of the sequence leads to a cleansing of the body through heat – enhancing circulation, alleviating joint pain, and building strength. When the postures are executed enough to be performed graciously, breathing becomes more even and ultimately cleanses the nervous system. Ashtanga Yoga allows you to develop a deep awareness of your breath and body. Similar to Bikram Yoga, the rigid sequence is known to help students develop a routine of self-discipline, grit, and consistency. This practice pushes you beyond your limits, constantly reminding you that you’re capable of much more than you realize!
In a led class, you are guided with a precise and traditional counting method, combined with specific breathing cues and points of focus, or “Drishti’s.” The cues help us keep our minds steady and focused throughout the class.
Ashtanga Yoga is usually practiced at room temperature, but we heat the room to 90 degrees. The heat relaxes your muscles, allowing you to go deeper into postures quickly.",ashtanga,,183,122,systematic incorporate sequence breath unite energetic nature sequence lead cleanse body heat enhance circulation alleviate joint pain build strength execute enough perform graciously breathe become ultimately cleanse nervous allow develop deep awareness breath body similar rigid sequence know help develop routine self discipline grit consistency push beyond limit constantly remind capable much realize lead guide precise traditional count method combine specific breathe cue point focus drishti cue help us keep mind steady focus throughout usually temperature heat 90 degrees heat relax muscle allow deeper quickly,0.17147715,0.048173413,0.40972033,0.0044557434,0.36617342,2,Deep Relaxation/Mind Practice
5,Baptiste Yoga,"""In order to make it easier to endure difficulties in life, they should first be experienced on the mat in the hall"", says the American yoga teacher Baron Baptiste, founder of the Baptiste Power Yoga.

Do you want to try a yoga trend, which gives an opportunity to people who are tense in the everyday life of a megalopolis, to strengthen your body through intense physical training, find flow and relax? Come to Baptiste Power Yoga classes at Studio One Yoga NYC.
What is Baptiste Power Yoga?
Baptiste Power Yoga is a yoga trend developed by Baron Baptiste based on the Baptiste Power Vinyasa style, which appeared more than 80 years ago thanks to his father, Walt Baptiste, a world-famous bodybuilder and Mr. America.
Baptiste Power Yoga is a symbiosis of practices based on the teachings of Walt Baptiste, B.K.S. Iyengar and Bikram Choudhury. It successfully combines elements of Ashtanga vinyasa, Bikram yoga and Iyengar yoga. The Baptiste Power Yoga is a vinyasa yoga, which includes a set of hatha yoga asanas and is held in a room heated to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, it is an intense workout that will literally make you sweat.
In general, the philosophy of Baron Baptiste yoga is a way to ground practitioners in the physical body, and from this state to encourage them to explore their own inner world.
Five Pillars of Baptiste Power Yoga
Breathing - is ujjayi; when the back of the throat is greatly strained and compressed, outwardly it looks like breathing to fog up a mirror when a person inhales and exhales through the nose. This technique allows you to develop the ability to slow down breathing, making it strong and deep, which is necessary during the practice of complex asanas. In addition, practitioners note that such breathing helps to keep calm.
Heat - is an opportunity to kindle an inner fire (tapas); therefore, to create such an atmosphere classes are held in the so–called hot halls;
Flow - is also associated with vinyasa–based breathing. In this series there are exercises that are performed standing up and work with the abdomen, back, and hips.
The direction of gaze - is drishti, this is one of the components of ashtanga yoga, which means looking at a certain place while performing yoga poses. Students are taught to focus their attention on any static point while doing exercises. This technique allows you to learn how to distract attention from everything external, focusing on yourself.
Core Stabilisation – uddiyana bandha, aimed at developing balance and strength. The exercises themselves are a retraction of the navel to the spine.

When the body enters a state of relaxation the mind can also consciously relax as tension is released from both body and mind. The only work that's required on your part during a restorative yoga practice is to pay attention to your breath and become aware of any sensations or thoughts that may arise.

Restorative classes are typically mellow and low-energy, making them a great complement to more active practices (as well as our busy lives) and an excellent antidote to stress.

148,Jivamukti yoga,"Jivamukti Yoga (Jivamukti Yoga) is a practice for calmness and self–confidence. It is a unique combination of physical exercises with spiritual practices, which include mantras, meditation, and the study of sacred texts. It allows you to learn to fully control your spiritual and physical condition.
The One Yoga NYC studio is a place where you can learn to master this practice, find a peace of mind, and give physical activity to your body.
The history of the practice
This style of yoga was developed by Americans David Life and Sharon Gannon in 1984 . The name consists of two words jiva (skt.) – living soul, mukti (skt.)–liberation. It is based on Pattabhi Joise's Ashtanga vinyasa, which Life and Gannon supplemented with new combinations of asanas; that smoothly flow into each other and resemble a dance.
Jivamukti yoga is based on five principles:
Ahimsa - non- harming , the practice of nonviolence towards others, including animals, therefore vegetarianism is its integral component
Bhakti - devotion to God, his knowledge and awareness
Dhyana - meditation, inner concentration to achieve spiritual insight
Nāda - centers on deep inner listening, chanting, and elevated music, an opportunity to learn to consciously hear and gain knowledge for the development of a healthy body and mind. The process of enlightenment begins with listerning.
Shastra - is the study of ancient yogic scriptures, chanting them in Sanskrit.
Sharon Gannon noted in an interview, Jivamukti yoga is a path to enlightenment through compassion for all living beings. This practice has found its fans all over the world. Many celebrities – Uma Thurman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Diane Keaton, Heidi Klum and many others have chosen this particular direction of yoga.
Features of the classes
We recommend Jivamukti Yoga NYC to those who do not want to limit themselves only to physical exercises, and intend to work on further self-development.
Each session includes both performing asanas and studying the scriptures (reading of fragments of ancient texts), chanting mantras, meditation. The exercises are
performed to music. The set of exercises is a smooth sequence of poses combined with breathing and flowing into each other. It is very effective and safe.
Jivamukti yoga practice helps to bring the body and the inner world of a person into harmony, having a restorative effect on the body:
It reveals the physical abilities of the body
Develops balance and increase flexibility, train muscles,
Relieves nervous tension
Helps with headaches, pressure loading, cardiovascular diseases
Relieves pain in the back and neck
Those who are already engaged in Jivamukti Yoga, note that this practice makes it possible to go beyond their own limitations, realizing that all limitations are illusory.

In Kundalini, physical postures (asana) sequences are called kriyas. Each kriya is a preset series of poses done with a specific breathing technique, blocking energy flow to certain areas of the body - bandhas - to intensify the effects of the pose.

The Kundalini is untapped energy, coiled at the base of the spine.1 This energy can be drawn up through the body, awakening each of the seven chakras. Full enlightenment occurs when this energy reaches the crown chakra at the top of the head.
While some people practice yoga solely for physical exercise, Kundalini Yoga is more of a spiritual practice. It is meant to quiet your mind while, at the same time, opening your chakras so your energy can freely flow throughout your body.

Life is filled with vibrant energy—everything and everyone we interact with is energy.

What Is Inferno Hot Pilates?
The Inferno Hot Pilates is a workout trend founded by Gabriella Walters, originally created to help people recover from injuries. IHP is based on breathing and balanced muscle workout, which increases strength and flexibility. This practice is suitable not only for those who is in need of recovery, but also for those who intend to correct their posture, lose weight, increase stamina, improve their skin and hair health.
This practice takes place in a room heated to 95 degrees Fahrenheit with 40% humidity. It stimulates sweating and helps to start important processes for healing the whole body:
• helps to reduce weight,
• improves blood and lymph circulation,
• increases flexibility,
• opens up joints,
• increases heart rate for a cardio effect.
This workout includes short series of high-intensity exercises alternated with low-intensity exercises, with time for recovery in between.
Special features
The IHP basic sequence includes several stages. In the beginning we start to warm up muscles of the pelvic floor and glutes, followed by activation of internal corset and abdominal workout. After that, we start plank series, where we alternate planks with back muscles training. The standing series include leg muscles workout, upper body and cardio. This combination trains cardiovascular system and breathing. As a result, almost all muscles of the body are involved.
Another important feature of this practice is the short duration of classes; 45 – 60 minutes. You will notice a visible result only after three workouts. When it comes
to weight loss, 20 minutes of intense exercise can burn the same number of calories as 45 minutes of running.
Advantages
Inferno Hot Pilates helps to remove excess weight, strengthen muscles, tighten the belly and pump up glutes.

Our bodies do not make the distinction between the small stresses of daily life (being late for work), a more serious personal crisis, or a life-threatening situation -- in all cases, bodies respond with the release of adrenaline, cortisol, and other hormones. Heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle tension are all increased. The body also shuts down systems that are deemed non-essential, such as digestion, elimination, growth, repair, and reproduction. This is great if we are being chased by a bear, but in most cases our bodies overreact to the chronic stress of our lives.",yoga,restore,225,158,give luxury lengthen relax muscle change body response stress antidote stress relaxation body need deep rest collapse couch front tv deep rest restorative help body mind relax allow us regain equilibrium little hold anywhere five 15 minutes part body completely support prop truly benefit restorative incorporate breathe little stretch keep fascia pliant joint mobile little restorative spend live fight flight sympathetic nervous body make distinction small stress daily life late serious personal crisis life threaten situation case body respond release adrenaline cortisol hormones heart rate blood pressure muscle tension increase body shut systems deem non essential digestion elimination growth repair reproduction great chase bear case body overreact chronic stress live,0.0047380333,0.220652,0.48789844,0.13804127,0.1486703,2,Deep Relaxation/Mind Practice

245,45min Beginners Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga,"What is Ashtanga Yoga?
In Sanskrit, ashtanga means eight-limbed (asta- eight, anga- limb). Ashtanga Yoga is an eight-limbed path towards achieving the state of Yoga, also known as Samadhi. 
The definition of Ashtanga Yoga is found in the Yoga Sutras of Patañjali, an ancient text on the theory and practice of Yoga thought to have been compiled in about 200 CE by Sage Patañjali. 
The Yoga Sutras of Patañjali is comprised of 196 sutras- short philosophical statements - on the theory and practice of Yoga, divided into four books, or padas. The Yoga Sutras are so succinct and are therefore almost incomprehensible without commentary. The most definitive commentary is by Veda Vyasa; his commentary is known as the Yoga Bhasya.
The Yoga Sutras begin with the highest teachings first, for those ready to enter into the final limbs of practice. In the second sutra of the first chapter, Samadhi Pada, we are offered the definition of Yoga: “Yogas citta vritti nirodah”, which can be translated as “Yoga is the cessation of the fluctuations of the mind.” When the mind is stilled, and the state of Yoga is reached, the individual mind is at one with the Universal Mind and individual consciousness with Divine Consciousness, and we experience our divinity through unity. 
Yoga is not only the state of Yoga, but also the practice, or sadhana, we engage in on the path towards Yoga. 
The definition of the eight-limbed path that leads to Yoga is found in book two of the Yoga Sutras of Patañjali, Sadhana Pada, the chapter on yoga practice. Sutra 2.29 states: “Yama-niyama-asana-pranayama-pratyahara-dharana-dyana-samadhyaya-astavangani.” This can be translated as: “the eight limbs of yoga are yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, and samadhi.” ",vinyasa,ashtanga,285,158,sanskrit mean eight limbed asta eight anga limb eight limbed path towards achieve state know samadhi definition find sutras pata jali ancient text theory think compile 200 ce sage pata jali sutras pata jali comprise 196 sutras short philosophical statements theory divide four book padas sutras succinct therefore almost incomprehensible without commentary definitive commentary veda vyasa commentary know bhasya sutras highest first ready enter final limbs second sutra first chapter samadhi pada definition yogas citta vritti nirodah translate cessation fluctuations mind mind still state reach individual mind universal mind individual consciousness divine consciousness experience divinity unity state sadhana engage path towards definition eight limbed path lead find book two sutras pata jali sadhana pada chapter sutra 2 29 state yama niyama pratyahara dharana dyana samadhyaya astavangani translate eight limbs yama niyama pratyahara dharana dhyana samadhi,0.011420504,0.9547918,0.01128104,0.011158686,0.01134796,1,Stress Relief/Breath Techniques

311,Yin Yoga,"While “Yang”’ yoga is centered around the more dynamic and active forms of yoga, such as Ashtanga, Power Vinyasa, and Bikram, Yin yoga is a quiet and reflective practice. It requires you to slow down and relax into easy postures. We hold each pose for 2-5 minutes at a time, allowing you to tune into your mind and the physical sensations of your body. Holding the posture passively lets you access the deep connective tissues between your ligaments, tendons, joints, and bones. Yin yoga originates from the Taoist concept of Yin and Yang, the interdependent characteristics of nature. Yin is the unwavering, concealed aspect of things and yang is the changing and eloquent aspect. The tendons, ligaments, and fascia are yin in the body, while the more tensile, pliable muscles are yang. Chinese and Taoist philosophies also believe there are pathways of Qi (energy) that runs through our bodies. It is thought to be that these pathways exist in the connective tissues of our body. By relaxing our muscles through deep stretching, we free any blockages that interrupt Qi from flowing continuously in our bodies.

However, if the practices or Sadhanas are all Rajasic (strong, heat building) this interplay is disturbed, and we are pushed out of harmony. Urban Sadhu Yoga Yin is designed to balance the Rajas tendencies. 
The revolutionary restorative process starts with organic and introspective movement, to bring awareness to the current state of the physical being before each asana is held for an extended 3 to 5 minutes.

Restorative yoga helps balance the sympathetic (fight or flight) and the parasympathetic (rest and digest) nervous systems through fully supported poses that allow each student to deeply relax the muscles of the body, while quieting the mind by focusing on the breath.

Yin Yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic (Yang) styles of yoga that emphasize lengthening and contracting our muscles.

410,YOGA TRI-GUNA,"Guna means qualities, tendencies, or energetic characteristics that are found in nature. In Samkhya philosophy, a guna is one of three “tendencies, qualities”: Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. This category of qualities has been widely adopted by various schools of Yoga psychology for categorizing behavior and natural phenomena. Yoga philosophy states that the goal of yoga, the state of union, is beyond the three gunas. 
In the Urban Sadhu Yoga Tri-Guna Class™ is divided into three equal sections of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas energetics. By giving equal time to the three energetics, the goal of the class is to balance the three gunas and overcome them. The class explores 25 minutes vigorous Vinyasa yoga, 25 minutes Yin style yoga, and 25 minutes pranayama and meditation with a final result of total yogic bliss or Samadhi.

When practiced according to his protocol, yoga can build bone mass and prevent osteoporotic fractures. It can also do so much more: With regular practice, you will become stronger and more balanced, in both your body and mind. We will practice traditional yoga poses proven to best stimulate bone growth, stay clear of poses that are inadvisable, and focus on form to avoid mistakes that could lead to injury.
